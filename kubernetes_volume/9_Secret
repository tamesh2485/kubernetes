Secrets used for sensitive , Data is encrypted at rest. We can enforce strong RBAC for secret 
Config Map stores non-secret data / it stores non-sensitive data. ConfigMap data is not encrypted.Hacker  can get the info of the configap as data is not encrypted. 

If data is changing, don’t store cm/secret as environment variable , store it as volume mount 

Secrets are not encrypted , they are encoded. secrets encode data in base64 format. Anyone with the base64 encoded secret can easily decode it. As such the secrets can be considered as not very safe.

Secrets are not encrypted, so it is not safer in that sense. However, some best practices around using secrets make it safer.
==========

Create Secret 
==========
kubectl create secret --help

kubectl create secret generic --help

kubectl create secret generic auth-secret --from-literal=admin=password

==========
Mount secret as volume 
==========
controlplane ~ ✖ cat pod.yaml 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secret-test-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test-container

        - name: secret-volume
          mountPath: /etc/secret-volume
          readOnly: true
  # The secret data is exposed to Containers in the Pod through a Volume.
  volumes:
